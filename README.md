# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Setup

## Overview

This Terraform script automates the provisioning of a complete infrastructure setup on Amazon Web Services (AWS), including Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, Security Groups, Route Tables, Ingress and Egress rules, Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service), and Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service). The goal of this repository is to provide a reproducible and scalable cloud architecture that can be easily modified according to the user's needs.

## Prerequisites

To use this Terraform script, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) (version 1.x or later)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with your AWS credentials)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) (for Kubernetes management)

## Components

### 1. VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

- **Description**: A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can define and control your virtual networking environment.
- **Configuration**: The script sets up a VPC with custom CIDR blocks, subnets (public and private), and internet gateways to facilitate communication both within and outside the cloud.

### 2. EC2 Instances

- **Description**: EC2 instances allow you to run virtual machines in the cloud.
- **Configuration**: The script defines EC2 instances tailored for your application, including their instance types, AMIs, and placement in the appropriate subnets.

### 3. Security Groups

- **Description**: Security Groups act as virtual firewalls for EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- **Configuration**: The script configures security groups with specified ingress and egress rules to allow secure communication between instances and external services.

### 4. Route Tables

- **Description**: Route Tables determine where network traffic is directed.
- **Configuration**: The script creates route tables that define how traffic flows within the VPC and to the internet.

### 5. Ingress and Egress Rules

- **Description**: These rules define which traffic is allowed in and out of your EC2 instances based on protocols, ports, and source/destination IPs.
- **Configuration**: Ingress rules allow you to specify access control for incoming traffic, whereas egress rules control the outbound traffic.

### 6. Amazon RDS

- **Description**: Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that simplifies database deployment, management, and scaling.
- **Configuration**: The script automates the creation of an RDS instance, specifying database engine (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL), instance class, storage type, and backup configurations.

### 7. Amazon EKS

- **Description**: Amazon EKS is a managed Kubernetes service for deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications using Kubernetes.
- **Configuration**: The script provisions an EKS cluster, including worker nodes, and sets up the necessary IAM roles and policies for secure operation.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
2. **Initialize Terraform:**
    ```bash
    terraform init
3. **Review the Plan:**
    ```bash
    terraform plan
4. **Apply the Configuration:**
    ```bash
    terraform apply
5. **Destroy the Infrastructure:**
If you want to tear down the infrastructure:
    ```bash
    terraform destroy

## Customization
You can customize the configurations by modifying the Terraform variables defined in the variables.tf file. Adjust parameters such as instance sizes, regions, or enable/disable specific components as per your application's requirements.
